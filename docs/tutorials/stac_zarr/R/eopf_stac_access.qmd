# Introduction

This tutorial will explore how to access the [EOPF Sample Service STAC catalog](https://stac.browser.user.eopf.eodc.eu/) programmatically using R.

TODO - include the content in https://github.com/eopf-toolkit/eopf-tooling-guide/blob/EOPF-47/docs/tutorials/stac_zarr.md? Link to it?

# Prerequisites

An R environment is required to follow this tutorial, with R version >= 4.1.0. We recommend using either [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) or [Positron](https://posit.co/products/ide/positron/) (or a cloud computing environment) and making use of [RStudio projects](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-RStudio-Projects) for a self-contained coding environment.

## Dependencies

The `rstac` package is required to follow this tutorial. You can install it directly from CRAN:

```{r install}
#| eval: false
install.packages("rstac")
```

Then load the package into your environment:

```{r load}
#| cache: false
library(rstac)
```

# Connect to the EOPF Sample Service STAC API

To access the EOPF Sample Service STAC catalog in R, we need to give the URL of the STAC API source ([https://stac.core.eopf.eodc.eu/](https://stac.core.eopf.eodc.eu/)) using the function `stac()`.
 
The object `stac_source` is a query containing information used _to_ connect to the API, but it does not actually make any requests. To make requests to the API, we will always need to use `get_request()` or `put_request()`, as appropriate. Running `get_request()` on `stac_source` actually retrieves the catalogue:

```{r get-api}
stac_source <- stac("https://stac.core.eopf.eodc.eu/")

stac_source |>
  get_request()
```

# Browse collections

A STAC _Collection_ exists to relate similar data sets together through space, time, and shared metadata. Each Sentinel mission and the downstream analysis-ready data are examples of STAC Collections. To browse STAC Collections, the `collections()` function is used. We can see that there are 11 collections available in the API:

```{r collections}
stac_collections <- stac_source |>
  collections() |>
  get_request()

stac_collections
```

The default printing of the `stac_collections()` object summarises what's been returned, but does not give all of the information. To see more about what's been returned, we use `str()`.

```{r collections-obj-details}
stac_collections |>
  str(max.level = 1)
```

Here, we can see that there is an entry `"collections"` within `stac_collections`, which we access to return the collections themselves (using `head()` to only return a few). This shows additional details about each collection, such as the collection id, title, description, and additional fields in the collections.

```{r collections-details}
stac_collections[["collections"]] |>
  head(n = 3)
```

The Sentinel-2 Level-2A collection can be accessed by getting the first entry in `stac_collections()[["collections"]]`

```{r collections-single-index}
stac_collections[["collections"]][[1]]
```

However, the best way to access a specific collection is to search for it directly using the collection ID. The ID, "sentinel-2-l2a", is visible in the Collection output above. It is also accessible in the browsable STAC catalog of the EOPF Sentinel Zarr Samples Service, on the [page for that collection](https://stac.browser.user.eopf.eodc.eu/collections/sentinel-2-l2a), under "Source."

![](images/eopf-stac-access-collections-id.png){width=800}

The collection ID can be supplied directly in the `collections()` function. If we look at the query without getting the result, we can see that it has been formed using the `collection_id`, "sentinel-2-l2a", as a filter parameter.

```{r get-collection-by-id-query}
sentinel_2_l2a_query <- stac_source |>
  collections(collection_id = "sentinel-2-l2a")

sentinel_2_l2a_query
```

And that running `get_request()` will return the collection itself:

```{r get-collection-by-id}
sentinel_2_l2a_query |>
  get_request()
```

# Browse items

Within collections, there are _items_. Items are the building blocks for STAC. At their core, they are GeoJSON data, along with additional metadata which ensures data provenance is maintained and specific data attributes are captured. A single capture from a Sentinel mission is an example of a STAC item. To get an overview of items within a collection, the `items()` function is used. 

An important thing to note with `rstac` is that you cannot continue to build queries on top of ones that have already had their results returned (via `get_request()`). It may make sense for a typical workflow in R to "get" the collection, then to try to get the items from it, but this will produce an error:

```{r item-error}
#| error: true
sentinel_2_l2a_collection <- stac_source |>
  collections(collection_id = "sentinel-2-l2a") |>
  get_request()

sentinel_2_l2a_collection |>
  items()
```

If you see this error --- `"Invalid rstac_query value"` --- ensure that you are running `get_request()` at the very end of your query building functions. Using `items()` this way, we can see that it returns a summary of the collection's items:

```{r get-items}
sentinel_2_l2a_collection_items <- stac_source |>
  collections(collection_id = "sentinel-2-l2a") |>
  items() |>
  get_request()

sentinel_2_l2a_collection_items
```

The first 10 items are returned. This number can be changed via the `limit` argument in `items()`

```{r get-items-limit}
stac_source |>
  collections(collection_id = "sentinel-2-l2a") |>
  items(limit = 20) |>
  get_request()
```

## Item properties

We can look closer at individual items to see the metadata attached to them. Items are stored under `"features"`:

```{r items-features}
sentinel_2_l2a_collection_items[["features"]] |>
  head(n = 2)
```

And an individual item contains a lot of information, such as its bounding box:

```{r item-bbox}
sentinel_2_l2a_first_item <- sentinel_2_l2a_collection_items[["features"]][[1]]

sentinel_2_l2a_first_item[["bbox"]]
```

And many more additional properties, with their properties under `"properties"` in an individual item.

```{r item-properties}
sentinel_2_l2a_first_item[["properties"]] |>
  names()
```

The introductory tutorial [further explains the metadata properties](https://github.com/eopf-toolkit/eopf-tooling-guide/blob/EOPF-47/docs/tutorials/stac_zarr.md#eopf-and-stac-extensions) and their extensions.

(TODO -- link on main branch once EOPF-47 is merged)

For example, the EOPF instrument mode:

```{r item-properties-example}
sentinel_2_l2a_first_item[["properties"]][["eopf:instrument_mode"]]
```

For the rest of the tutorial, we will use a small helper function that accesses a given property for the _first_ item returned in a search.

```{r get-item-property}
get_first_item_property <- function(search_results, property) {
  search_results[["features"]][[1]][["properties"]][[property]]
}

sentinel_2_l2a_collection_items |>
  get_first_item_property("eopf:instrument_mode")
```

## Search for items

If the goal is to access data from a specific mission, it is best to _search_ within a collection's items, using some of the properties explored above. It's possible to search based on a number of criteria, including a bounding box, time frame, and other mission properties.

### Search by a bounding box

To narrow down items based on a bounding box or time frame, the `stac_search()` function is used. The collection ID is provided in the `collections()` argument, and bounding box and time frame are `bbox` and `datetime`, respectively.

The bounding box values take the sequence of: minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude, and maximum latitude, and their coordinate reference system is WGS84.

```{r search-items-bbox}
stac_source |>
  stac_search(
    collections = "sentinel-2-l2a",
    bbox = c(-47.02148, -17.35063, -42.53906, -12.98314)
  ) |>
  get_request()
```

This does -- again by default -- return the first 10 items, but the number returned can be increased via the `limit` argument in `stac_search()`.

### Search by a time frame

When searching for a specific time frame, items that have a datetime property that _intersects_ with the given time frame will be returned. It's therefore best to search for a closed or open interval, rather than a specific date and time (which might be difficult to match exactly to an item's time!). The date-time must be given in RFC 3339 format.

To search for a closed interval, separate two date-times by a "/", e.g. `"2024-12-01T01:00:00Z/2024-12-01T05:00:00Z"`:

```{r search-items-datetime-closed-interval}
matching_timeframe_items <- stac_source |>
  stac_search(
    collections = "sentinel-2-l2a",
    datetime = "2024-12-01T01:00:00Z/2024-12-01T05:00:00Z"
  ) |>
  get_request()

matching_timeframe_items
```

We can access the matching item's `datetime` property to see that it falls within the specified interval:

```{r search-items-datetime-closed-interval-examine-property}
matching_timeframe_items |>
  get_first_item_property("datetime")
```

To search by an open interval, ".." is used to indicate the open end, e.g. `"../2024-01-01T23:00:00Z"` representing prior to that date-time, and `"2024-01-01T23:00:00Z/.."` representing after it:

```{r search-items-datetime-open-interval}
stac_source |>
  stac_search(
    collections = "sentinel-2-l2a",
    datetime = "2025-01-01T23:00:00Z/.."
  ) |>
  get_request()
```

### Search by other item properties

As shown above, there are a number of other properties attached to STAC items. We can also search using these properties. The `stac_search()` function is limited to properties like bounding box and time frame, so instead we use `ext_filter()`. This is a function that makes use of the Common Query Language (CQL2) filter extension, and allows us to do more complicated searching and querying using SQL-like language. It is also important to note that when using `ext_filter()`, we switch to using `post_request()` instead of `get_request()`.

To search for items whose platform is "sentinel-2b", for example, we use `==` to indicate equality:

```{r search-items-extfilter}
sentinel_2b_platform_results <- stac_source |>
  stac_search(collections = "sentinel-2-l2a") |>
  ext_filter(platform == "sentinel-2b") |>
  post_request()

sentinel_2b_platform_results

sentinel_2b_platform_results |>
  get_first_item_property("platform")
```

If the search value is contained in another variable, the variable must be escaped in the search by using double curly braces:

```{r search-items-extfilter-variable}
search_platform <- "sentinel-2b"

sentinel_2b_platform_results <- stac_source |>
  stac_search(collections = "sentinel-2-l2a") |>
  ext_filter(platform == {{ search_platform }}) |>
  post_request()

sentinel_2b_platform_results |>
  get_first_item_property("platform")
```

Note also that there is no `limit` argument in `ext_filter()`. To limit the number of items returned, the limit is supplied in `stac_search()` beforehand, since these search functions build upon one another:

```{r search-items-extfilter-limit}
stac_source |>
  stac_search(collections = "sentinel-2-l2a", limit = 1) |>
  ext_filter(platform == {{ search_platform }}) |>
  post_request()
```

And to search for items with cloud cover of less than 40, we use `<=`:

```{r search-items-extfilter-cloudcover}
stac_source |>
  stac_search(collections = "sentinel-2-l2a") |>
  ext_filter(`eo:cloud_cover` <= 40) |>
  post_request() |>
  get_first_item_property("eo:cloud_cover")
```

To search for items whose instrument is "msi", we use the `a_contains()` function. We need to use this instead of `==` because `instruments` can contain multiple values, and `a_contains()` searches for the value `"msi"` within the list of values that is `instruments`.

```{r search-items-extfilter-instruments}
stac_source |>
  stac_search(collections = "sentinel-2-l2a") |>
  ext_filter(a_contains(instruments, "msi")) |>
  post_request() |>
  get_first_item_property("instruments")
```

Note that there is currently a bug with how the `rstac` package converts the API's data to an R object. This bug makes it unclear that `instruments` is a _list_ that needs to be searched within (instead of a single value). There is an [issue to fix this bug in the `rstac` github repository](https://github.com/brazil-data-cube/rstac/issues/175).

If you are having trouble searching within properties that look like single values, it is a good idea to look for the JSON specification of the property in the [STAC Specification repository](github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/item-spec/json-schema/instrument.json). For example, for the `instruments` property, we can look in the [intstrument.json](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/item-spec/json-schema/instrument.json) file and see that it is an _array_ (what is called a list in R), while `platform` is just a string.

```json
"properties": {
    "platform": {
      "title": "Platform",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "instruments": {
      "title": "Instruments",
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "string"
      }
    }
}
```

The [documentation for `ext_filter()`](https://brazil-data-cube.github.io/rstac/reference/ext_filter.html#details) contains information on how to construct many more searches than we've shown here.

### Combine search criteria

You can combine multiple filter criteria by specifying them together. We have already seen how to combine multiple criteria (collection ID and bounding box, for example) in `stac_search()` by using the named arguments. We can also filter by bounding box and datetime in the same way. Multiple criteria in `ext_filter()` are separated by `&&`:

```{r search-items-multiple-criteria}
multiple_criteria_items <- stac_source |>
  stac_search(
    collections = "sentinel-2-l2a",
    bbox = c(-47.02148, -17.35063, -42.53906, -12.98314),
    datetime = "../2025-01-01T23:00:00Z"
  ) |>
  ext_filter(
    platform == "sentinel-2a" &&
    `eo:cloud_cover` <= 40
  ) |>
  post_request()

multiple_criteria_items |>
  get_first_item_property("datetime")

multiple_criteria_items |>
  get_first_item_property("platform")

multiple_criteria_items |>
  get_first_item_property("eo:cloud_cover")
```

# Browse assets

Finally, assets fall under STAC items and direct users to the actual data itself. Each asset refers to data associated with the Item that can be downloaded or streamed.

We will look at the assets for a specific item from the Sentinel-2 Level-2A collection. Like collections, items can be filtered by their IDs. Their IDs are also available through the API:

```{r show-item-id}
sentinel_2_l2a_collection_items[["features"]][[1]]
```

Or through the STAC catalog of the EOPF Sentinel Zarr Samples Service, on the [page for that item](https://stac.browser.user.eopf.eodc.eu/collections/sentinel-2-l2a/items/S2A_MSIL2A_20250517T085541_N0511_R064_T35QKA_20250517T112203), under "Source":

![](images/eopf-stac-access-items-id.png){width=800}

To select a single item, supply its ID in the `items()` function:

```{r select-item}
example_item <- stac_source |>
  collections("sentinel-2-l2a") |>
  items("S2A_MSIL2A_20250517T085541_N0511_R064_T35QKA_20250517T112203") |>
  get_request()

example_item
```

There are a number of helpful functions for working with an item's assets, such as `items_assets()` which lists them:

```{r list-assets}
# List the assets in an item
example_item |>
  items_assets()
```

And `assets_select()` which allows us to select specific assets (in this case, the "Surface Reflectance - 10m" asset):

```{r select-assets}
sr_10m <- example_item |>
  assets_select(asset_names = "SR_10m")

sr_10m
```

In particular, the "product" asset will be useful to working with EOPF Sample Service Zarr data, as this is the top-level Zarr hierarchy and will be used to actually access Zarr data. We can select this asset, and then use `assets_url()` to get its URL:

```{r asset-select-product}
example_item |>
  assets_select(asset_names = "product") |>
  assets_url()
```

This leads into our next tutorial, where this asset and URL will be used to access and work with Zarr data.
