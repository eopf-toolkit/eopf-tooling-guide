# Loading and Analyzing Zarr Data from a STAC Catalog

This tutorial will guide you through the process of discovering, loading, and analyzing multi-dimensional Zarr datasets using a SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC). It is intended for data scientists and developers who are familiar with Python and xarray, but new to STAC concepts and tools such as `pystac` and `pystac-client`.

## Introduction

Zarr is a format for the storage of chunked, compressed, N-dimensional arrays. STAC provides a standardized way to describe geospatial assets, including Zarr datasets. This tutorial demonstrates how to use STAC tools to find and access Zarr data, and how to analyze it with familiar Python libraries.

---

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with Python
- Experience working with Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts
- Familiarity with xarray for multi-dimensional data analysis

---

## Setting Up Your Python Environment

We recommend using a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can use `venv`, `conda`, or `mamba`.

### Using `venv` and `pip`

```bash
python3 -m venv stac-zarr-env
source stac-zarr-env/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install xarray zarr pystac pystac-client s3fs matplotlib
```

### Using `conda` or `mamba`

```bash
conda create -n stac-zarr-env python=3.10
conda activate stac-zarr-env
conda install -c conda-forge xarray zarr pystac pystac-client s3fs matplotlib
```

## STAC Concepts Overview

> **Placeholder:**  
> Briefly introduce the SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) specification, its core concepts (Catalog, Collection, Item, Asset), and why it is useful for discovering and describing geospatial data.

---

## Discovering Zarr Assets in a STAC Catalog

> **Placeholder:**  
> Show how to use `pystac-client` to search a STAC API for Zarr assets.  
> - Example: connecting to a public STAC API  
> - Filtering for Zarr assets  
> - Inspecting returned items and assets

---

## Loading Zarr Data with xarray

> **Placeholder:**  
> Demonstrate how to use xarray and zarr to open a remote Zarr store referenced in a STAC Item.  
> - Using `s3fs` for S3-backed Zarr  
> - Handling authentication if needed  
> - Inspecting the xarray dataset

---

## Analyzing the Data

> **Placeholder:**  
> Provide example analyses using xarray, such as:  
> - Plotting a variable  
> - Computing statistics  
> - Slicing by time or space

---

## Best Practices and Tips

> **Placeholder:**  
> Tips for working with large Zarr datasets, optimizing performance, and using STAC metadata effectively.
