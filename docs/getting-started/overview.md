# Overview of EOPF Tooling

This document provides an overview of the tools available in the EOPF Toolkit. The toolkit is designed to help developers and users work with Sentinel data in the EOPF Zarr format.

## Core Concepts

- **EOPF Zarr:** A specification for storing Earth Observation data in a cloud-native format.
- **STAC:** SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogs provide a standardized way to discover and access geospatial data.

## Available Tools

- **Python Libraries:** For accessing and processing EOPF Zarr data.
- **QGIS Plugin:** For visualizing EOPF data in QGIS.
- **GDAL Driver:** For compatibility with GDAL-based workflows.

## Tutorials

This section provides links to tutorials that will help you get started with the EOPF Toolkit.
